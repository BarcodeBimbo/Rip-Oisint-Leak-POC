# OSINTLeak Username Search Tool

## Description
This Python script allows you to search for username information using the OSINTLeak API. It provides a simple command-line interface to search for usernames and decrypt the retrieved data.

## The Start

Created an account found the search api endpoint via dev-tools

</div>

After creating a request to the api i found that the response was encoded, so i need to dig abit to learn how data was being served on the frontend

## More Digging

Then I started reversing the js
```python
import requests, jsbeautifier

def js_beautifier(url):
    response  = requests.get(url=url)
    if response.ok:
        return jsbeautifier.beautify(response.text)
 
with open("swag.js", "w", encoding="utf-8") as clean_js:
    clean_js.write(js_beautifier("https://osintleak.com/_nuxt/D-7P-sjM.js"))
```

On line: 2868 is the start of the decoder logic.

</div>

Now that i have the logic on how data is served to the frontend it was time to recrate this in python
